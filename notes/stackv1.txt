This document details the first electronics stack for the tufts robotic sail team boat. 

0. Purpose
    Electronics stack v1 is built to collect data while a human controls the boat via remote control. This data will allow development of a machine learning algorithm for autonomous control of the boat. 

1. Components
    a. Computing Components
        i.   Raspberry Pi Model B+
        ii.  Arduino Uno
        iii. Can-Bus Arduino Shield
    b. Sensors
        i.   Airmar WX200 Model Ultrasonic Wind Sensor


2. Configuration
    Stack v1 will serve to collect data for future use in algorithm development.
    The data will be passed along through the stack to eventually be stored in an micro-SD card attached to the Raspberry Pi
    Sensors --> Can-Bus --> Arduino --> Pi
