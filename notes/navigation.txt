Notes from symposium talk:

POMDP -- partiallyo observable markov decision process
	have a belief state... which is continually narrowed down
	uhoh dimension is exponential to state variables -- planning is polynomial to dimension

Predictive State Representations -- more efficient planning
	predict a future from small set of futures -- no hidden variables
Belief State Compression
	linear function to compress yet minimize difference in output
Decentralized POMDP
	multiple robots, what the other robot might do is another belief state
	plan strategy accordingly
	policy space compression
		view as a linear matrx, keep small subset to program, and recompute probabilities on rest of policies
		by multiplying by constant weights

	possibly: R = wT * observable features
			  Therefore the policy value is linear as compared to the observable features with weights
	to find reward function maximize the value of the experts policy (which is not known but simulated and found a similar policy)
	This implements imitation of the "expert" -- Relative Entropy Inverse Optimal Control



	Questions:

	Convex problem?
