Tufts Robotic Sailing Information Sheet—Sailbot Competition
Created by Kelsey Foster 1/9/2017

Boat Specifications:
•	Length: max 2 m (sensors not included)
•	Beam: max 3 m with zero heel
•	Draft: max 1.5 m in normal sailing coniditions
•	Height: max 5 m (sensors not included)

Other Rules:
•	Need a stand to support the boat
•	No direct human contact
•	Need full remote radio at all times during competition to avoid collisions
•	Data transfer to shore is unlimited, must be at an approved frequency
•	Any material can be used
•	Bilge pumps are permitted
•	Sail configuration changes can occur during the race but only by an onboard system

Competitions:
•	Fleet race:
o	Group of boats sail between two buoys and around two other bouys
o	Use remote control for steering and autonomous sails
o	Fastest boat gets 10 points
 
•	Station Keeping
o	Boat autonomously stays in 40x40 m box for 5 minutes
o	Exits within 30 seconds
o	Can leave and return the box but there are point deductions
 
•	Precision Navigation
o	Autonomously sail around 2 buoys, start and end through a start/finish line
 
•	Payload
o	Start between two buoys, sail around a buoy and back
o	Remote or autonomous
o	Boat carries cargo, scoring is based on the percentage of the boat’s empty weight that the cargo represents
 
•	Collision Avoidance
o	Start between 2 buoys, round a buoy and return
o	Sail autonomously on a reach
o	Must avoid a collision
 
•	Search
o	Small buoy placed within 100 m of starting position
o	Boat locates and touches buoy within 5 mins
o	Boat must indicate it found the buoy with flashing white strobe light or signal to shore station
 
•	Long Distance Race
o	Sail around 4 buoys for up to 8 hours
o	1 pt for each lap
o	Must be within 10 m of each buoy
o	Remote control is allowed but there is 50 percent deduction
o	Additional pt for each extra hour sailed with no pitstop
 
•	Presentation
o	Topics: workmanship, innovation, control theory, boat design, student involvement
o	Each team presents to panel of experts in area of control theory, systems engineering, and naval architecture
o	20 minute presentation, 10 minute Q&A
