This file details the program structure of the trst project, specifically those
processes running on the raspberry pi.

start.sh        --  starts all necessary processes:
                        1. server/app.js
                        2. uploader.py
                        3. navigator.py

app.js          --  node/express server running on localhost:8888
                    responsible for structuring sensor data
                    (logs to log/server.log)

uploader.py     --  adapter from arduino0 (sensor) to port express server
                    (logs to log/upload.log)

navigator.py    --  two modes: manual, auto (mode set at BOF)
                        user mode is used to control the boat servos directly
                        primary use is for debugging/testing

                        auto mode is used when the boat takes control 

                    communicates through driver.py
                    (logs to log/navigator.log)

driver.py       --  drivers for pyserial 
                    (logs to log/driver.log)

boatstate.py    -- keeps all servo information and state of rudder/sail servos
